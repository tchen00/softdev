                <h2>Things you never knew</h2>
                <p>"The word koala comes from the Dharug gula, meaning no water.[4] Although the vowel 'u' was originally written in the English orthography as "oo" (in spellings such as coola or koolah), it was changed to "oa", possibly in error.[5] Because of the koala's supposed resemblance to a bear, it was often miscalled the koala bear, particularly by early settlers.[6] The generic name, Phascolarctos, is derived from the Greek words phaskolos "pouch" and arktos "bear". The specific name, cinereus, is Latin for "ash coloured".[7]</p>

                <p>Traditionally, three distinct subspecies have been recognised: the Queensland koala (P. c. adustus, Thomas 1923), the New South Wales koala (P. c. cinereus, Goldfuss 1817), and the Victorian koala (P. c. victor, Troughton 1935). These forms are distinguished by pelage colour and thickness, body size, and skull shape. The Queensland koala is the smallest of the three, with shorter, silver fur and a shorter skull. The Victorian koala is the largest, with shaggier, brown fur and a wider skull.[20][21] The boundaries of these variations are based on state borders, and their status as subspecies is disputed. A 1999 genetic study suggests that the variations represent differentiated populations with limited gene flow between them, and that the three subspecies comprise a single evolutionarily significant unit.[21] Other studies have found that koala populations have high levels of inbreeding and low genetic variation.[22][23] Such low genetic diversity may have been a characteristic of koala populations since the late Pleistocene.[24] Rivers and roads have been shown to limit gene flow and contribute to the genetic differentiation of southeast Queensland populations.[25] In April 2013, scientists from the Australian Museum and Queensland University of Technology announced they had fully sequenced the koala genome.[26]" ~Wikipedia </p>

                <p>"The koala is a stocky animal with a large head and vestigial or non-existent tail.[27][28] It has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and a weight of 4–15 kg (9–33 lb),[28] making it among the largest arboreal marsupials.[29] Koalas from Victoria are twice as heavy as those from Queensland.[20] The species is  dimorphic, with males 50% larger than females. Males are further distinguished from females by their
                <p> The pelage of the koala is thicker and longer on the back, and shorter on the belly. The ears have thick fur on both the inside and outside.[29] The back fur colour varies from light grey to chocolate brown.[27] The belly fur is whitish; on the rump it is dappled whitish, and darker at the back.[28] The koala has the most effective insulating back fur of any marsupial and is highly resilient to wind and rain, while the belly fur can reflect solar radiation.[34] The koala's curved, sharp claws are well adapted for climbing trees. The large forepaws have two opposable digits (the first and second, which are opposable to the other three) that allow them to grasp small branches. On the hindpaws, the second and third digits are fused, a typical condition for members of the Diprotodontia, and the attached claws (which are still separate) are used for grooming.[35] As in humans and other primates, koalas have friction ridges on their paws.[36] The animal has a sturdy skeleton and a short, muscular upper body with proportionately long upper limbs that contribute to its climbing and grasping abilities. Additional climbing strength is achieved with thigh muscles that attach to the shinbone lower than other animals.[37] The koala has a cartilaginous pad at the end of the spine that may make it more comfortable when it perches in the fork of a tree.[33]</p>
                <p> The koala has one of the smallest brains in proportion to body weight of any mammal,[38] being 60% smaller than that of a typical diprotodont, weighing only 19.2 g (0.68 oz).[39] The brain's surface is fairly smooth, typical for a "primitive" animal.[40] It occupies only 61% of the cranial cavity[38] and is pressed against the inside surface by cerebrospinal fluid. The function of this relatively large amount of fluid is not known, although one possibility is that it acts as a shock absorber, cushioning the brain if the animal falls from a tree.[40] The koala's small brain size may be an adaptation to the energy restrictions imposed by its diet, which is insufficient to sustain a larger brain.[38] Because of its small brain, the koala has a limited ability to perform complex, unfamiliar behaviours. For example, when presented with plucked leaves on a flat surface, the animal cannot adapt to the change in its normal feeding routine and will not eat the leaves.[41] The koala's olfactory senses are normal, and it is known to sniff the oils of individual branchlets to assess their edibility.[38] Its nose is fairly large and covered in leathery skin. Its round ears provide it with good hearing,[33] and it has a well-developed middle ear.[14] A koala's vision is not well developed,[33] and its relatively small eyes are unusual among marsupials in that the pupils have vertical slits.[29] Koalas make use of a novel vocal organ to produce low-pitched sounds (see social spacing, below). Unlike typical mammalian vocal cords, which are folds in the larynx, these organs are placed in the velum (soft palate) and are called velar vocal cords.[42]" ~Wikipedia </p>
