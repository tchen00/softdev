Got more from the football dream of not accomplishing it than accomplishing it
- Football got me where I am today
- Fundamentals & hard work
- Experience is what you get when you didn’t get what you wanted
- Most of what we learn, we learn indirectly (or by head fake)
Keep following your dreams

"Don't complain, work harder." Made me realize that in life you treat people good and life will take care of itself
''Luck is where preparation meets opportunity.''
"When you do the right thing good stuff has a way of happening"
I love paunch’s wisdom, humility, character and empathy for others! His words of wisdom should be spread!
