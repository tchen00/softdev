NOTES
- SVG charts created with smooth transition + interaction
- bind arbitrary data to a DOM
- Selections
	- made easy with d3.selectAll(<tag>) etc
	- can also be selected by attribute, class, ID etc
	- event listeners
  - selection.data (computes the enter, update & exit selection)
  - selection.join (appends/removes the elements)
- easy to debug with the console/inspector

TRANSITIONS
	- animated, supports primitives and compound values
	- ex: d3.select("body").transition().style("background-color", "black");
		- background fades to black :o
	- can also define functions for timing (i.e delay)
		- right now extremely confusing, read up on it later

D3: LEARN BY EXAMPLE
  import {chart as chart1} with {values as data} from "@d3/histogram"
    - unique to Observable JS: with clause substitutes values array of numbers as data
  d3 & summary statistics
    - d3. count, d3. sum, d3. mean, d3. median
    - helpful for basic computations!
  d3 & random
    - d3-random: implements random number generators for various probability distributions
    - d3.randomNormal: normal distribution of bell-curve
