- SVG charts created with smooth transition + interaction
- bind arbitrary data to a DOM
- Selections
	- made easy with d3.selectAll(<tag>) etc
	- can also be selected by attribute, class, ID etc
	- event listeners !!!!!!! *read more later*
- easy to debug with the console/inspector
- TRANSITIONS
	- animated, supports primitives and compound values
	- ex: d3.select("body").transition().style("background-color", "black");
		- background fades to black :o
	- can also define functions for timing (i.e delay)
		- right now extremely confusing, read up on it later
