v1
- prediction: an alert of the word you clicked on will pop up
- result: worked as expected; (when clicking on a table cell)

v2
- prediction: 3 alerts will pop up, first of the word in the cell, second of the HTML for the row, third of the HTML for the table
- result: worked as expected; (when clicking the cell)

v3:
- prediction: 3 alerts will pop up (different order than 2), first the entire HTML of the table, second the word in the cell, third the HTML of the row
- result: order correct!
          when e.stopPropagation() gets uncommented, only one alert pops up (entire HTML of the table). this is likely b/c it is the first alert and the propagation ends.

v4:
- prediction: 3 alerts will pop up (different order from the other two), first the HTML of the table, second the HTML of the row, and third the word in the cell
- result: order correct!
          same as v3 -- when e.stopPropagation() gets uncommented, only one alert pops up (entire HTML of the table). this is likely b/c it is the first alert and the propagation ends.
          order of event listeners does not matter
